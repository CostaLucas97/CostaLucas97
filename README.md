- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lucas. I'm an recently graduated Economist,
and I love computers, so I decided to take this as carreer. Somehow I always heard a calling to learn programming,
but it took me a while to actually see this as a potential carreer, so here I am, learning Javascript, for now focusing
on the front end, but looking foward to immerse myself in back end as well. I am also interested in Data Science, and
I plan on using that on the future.
